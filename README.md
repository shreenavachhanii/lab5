Dataset
The Fish Market dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle. The dataset contains information about different species of fish and their respective features.

Model
The machine learning model is built using Scikit-learn and trained to classify fish species based on features such as weight, length, and height.

Web Application
The web application is built using Flask and provides a frontend interface to input fish features and get predictions. The application is deployed on Heroku.

Deployment
The application is deployed on Heroku. The Heroku app can be accessed at the following URL: Heroku App

Usage
Navigate to the web application URL.
Enter the features of the fish (weight, length, etc.) in the provided input fields.
Click the "Predict" button to get the predicted fish species.
